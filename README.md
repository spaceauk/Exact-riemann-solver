Make use of the Newton-Raphson (NR) method, which requires only the first-order derivative and is suitable for finding the roots of a function. Additionally, consider the Halley method, a higher-order extension of the NR method, which requires both the first and second-order derivatives and provides faster convergence rates for certain types of functions.
